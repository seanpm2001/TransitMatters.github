Welcome to the TransitMatters GitHub page! We are a Boston-based transit advocacy and policy group with a mission to provide data-driven advocacy for a more reliable, sustainable, and equitable transit system in Metropolitan Boston.

This page is run by TransitMatters Labs, the technical wing of the organization responsible for applications such as the [Data Dashboard](https://dashboard.transitmatters.org/) and [New Train Tracker](https://traintracker.transitmatters.org/).
